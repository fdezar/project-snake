# Project Snake Game

Snake is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the game board, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the game board edges. This project implements the Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Done in collaboration with MarcelCostaFerre, as our first Ironhack project.
