Snake Game created in HTML, CSS, and Javascript by fdezar and MarcelCostaFerre, created in collaboration in order to accomplish Ironhack's first project requirement (a JS game). It presents the original Snake game rules, eating random-generated food, and dying if the snake touches itself or the walls.

Project does not have dependencies, it can be played directly on the browser.

How to play
- In order to start the game, press an arrow key.
- Press any arrow key in order to move the snake.
- Eat as much food as possible without dying.
